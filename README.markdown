Moonmoon is a web based aggregator similar to planetplanet. 
It can be used to blend articles from different blogs with same interests into a single page.

Moonmoon is stupidly simple: it only aggregates feeds and spits them out in one single page. 
It does not archive articles, it does not do comments nor votes.


Requirements
------------
Web hosting with PHP5 (PHP4 will not work).

License

Moonmoon is free software and is released under BSD license.
